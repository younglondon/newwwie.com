      "description": "Howdy Coders,\nThis month we'll have two great speakers with:\n\n* Gayan Fonseska speaking about API Security\n* Adam Cogan giving us a preview of his NDC Oslo talk \"Shaving the Yak with AI ‚û°Ô∏è Devs want specs, Product Owners want speed\".\n\nAgenda:\n6:00: Doors Open, Pizza and Drinks\n6:30: News\n6:45: Gayan Fonseka\n7:30: Short break\n7:40: Adam Cogan\n8:30: Drinks and networking\n9:00: Doors close\n\nTransport:\nClosest parking: Museum Carpark\nClosest public transport: Civic Light Rail\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nSSW\nSaphi Engineering\n\n**About Adams Talk:**\nLearn how AI can change the game in an important scenario. The age-old battle between Product Owners and Developers rages on: POs push for speed, while devs demand clarity. When specs are too vague, developers waste time making assumptions. When specs are too detailed, POs get bogged down in documentation.\nThe result? Context switching, frustration, and a backlog filled with half-baked work items.\nIn this talk, Adam Cogan will show how AI powered tools like **YakShaver** (for GitHub and Azure DevOps) and recently **Loom** (for Jira) can act as the ultimate peacemaker.\nThese tools capture discussions, structuring work items, and ensuring that every backlog item is ready‚Ä¶ and assigned to the right backlog‚Äîall automatically.\nLearn the lessons from deploying AI to solve one of the most persistent struggles in software development. This talk will show you how AI brings balance to your team.\nBonus: See how a solution can be:\n\\* better with Microsoft Teams to capture audio + video, and leverage Whisper for transcription, all glued together with GPT-4o to generate structured content.\n\\* have a decision-tree architecture with Semantic Kernel orchestration to enable seamless integration with Azure DevOps, GitHub, and more.",

      "title": "WGDPTech Meet-up: Anna Starrett - A zebra in a field of giraffes",
      "description": "We excited for our April speaker, Anna Starrett!\n\n**About the talk:**\nAnna has spent most of her career in management roles within the mining and industrial sectors, often the odd one out, as the youngest person in the room, the oldest, the least or perhaps the most experienced, and at times, the only female among a group of predominantly male colleagues. These experiences have shaped her career and her approach to leadership in significant ways. Anna will share personal stories and lessons she‚Äôs learned over the years, particularly the unique challenges she faced navigating these spaces where she often didn‚Äôt fit the typical mould. She‚Äôll reflect on the value of embracing differences rather than simply focusing on diversity as a goal in itself - the importance of recognizing and appreciating the different perspectives and experiences that each individual brings to the table. She will encourage you to use your differences‚Äînot as barriers, but as assets. and to understand that what often makes us feel like an outsider can actually be the key to success.\n\n**About Anna:**\nAnna is a member of the Executive team at MGA Thermal. Over the course of her career, spanning Finance, Operations and General Management she has led global teams through a wide range of high stakes situations, from the excitement of startups, the rapid growth of scaleups and the challenging but critical task of managing shut-downs. She is focussed on creating an environment where individuals feel valued, heard, and empowered to contribute their unique perspectives and skills. Anna has expertise in strategic human resource management, change management and process improvement. A Chartered accountant and graduate of AICD, she is currently completing her masters in Organisational Leadership at Oxford.\n\n**5:30PM:** The event starts with a catch-up\n**6:00PM:** The presentation will begin\n\nWe'll gather at the NewyTechPeople office at 9 Downie St, Maryville NSW for this event.\n\nEveryone is welcome to this event, regardless of gender- so share it with your friends. Through these speaker events, we aim to share experiences and knowledge, that's how we learn, and that's how we can improve the community for everyone. We provide food, so let us know of any allergies :)",
