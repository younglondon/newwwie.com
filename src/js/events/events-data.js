      "description": "Howdy Coders,\nFresh off the back of SlashNEW we'll have Klee Thomas giving us a talk about the written but poorly understood rules of software development.\n\nWe'll be at the Endava Offices in Hunter street.\n\nWe'd like to thank our sponsors:\n\n* Saphi Engineering\n* Newy Tech People\n* Endava\n\n**About the talk**\nHave you ever sat in a meeting where some smarty pants developer has mentioned “Someone’s” Law/Principle/Principle/etc and just expected that you knew it? I have and it made me feel ignorant and uneducated. Come with me as dive into the key laws that software developers and those around software developers should be aware of and how these laws apply to the work we do every day.\nI’m not a lawyer and this is not about anything legal just the unofficial rules that govern the world of software development.\n\n**About Klee**\nKlee is a Software Developer working at Atlassian, and organiser of the Newcastle Coders Group. He is an advocate of agile and Clean Code software development methodologies who loves to talk about what we can do to build better quality, maintainable software. Outside of software development Klee is a fan of Martial Arts, Motorcycles, Netflix and spending time with his wife and cats.",
