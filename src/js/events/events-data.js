      "title": "WGDPTech Meet-up: Anna Starrett - A zebra in a field of giraffes",
      "description": "We excited for our April speaker, Anna Starrett!\n\n**About the talk:**\nAnna has spent most of her career in management roles within the mining and industrial sectors, often the odd one out, as the youngest person in the room, the oldest, the least or perhaps the most experienced, and at times, the only female among a group of predominantly male colleagues. These experiences have shaped her career and her approach to leadership in significant ways. Anna will share personal stories and lessons she’s learned over the years, particularly the unique challenges she faced navigating these spaces where she often didn’t fit the typical mould. She’ll reflect on the value of embracing differences rather than simply focusing on diversity as a goal in itself - the importance of recognizing and appreciating the different perspectives and experiences that each individual brings to the table. She will encourage you to use your differences—not as barriers, but as assets. and to understand that what often makes us feel like an outsider can actually be the key to success.\n\n**About Anna:**\nAnna is a member of the Executive team at MGA Thermal. Over the course of her career, spanning Finance, Operations and General Management she has led global teams through a wide range of high stakes situations, from the excitement of startups, the rapid growth of scaleups and the challenging but critical task of managing shut-downs. She is focussed on creating an environment where individuals feel valued, heard, and empowered to contribute their unique perspectives and skills. Anna has expertise in strategic human resource management, change management and process improvement. A Chartered accountant and graduate of AICD, she is currently completing her masters in Organisational Leadership at Oxford.\n\n**5:30PM:** The event starts with a catch-up\n**6:00PM:** The presentation will begin\n\nWe'll gather at the NewyTechPeople office at 9 Downie St, Maryville NSW for this event.\n\nEveryone is welcome to this event, regardless of gender- so share it with your friends. Through these speaker events, we aim to share experiences and knowledge, that's how we learn, and that's how we can improve the community for everyone. We provide food, so let us know of any allergies :)",
