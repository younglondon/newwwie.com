      "description": "Painting with numbers: Newcastle’s Tech Community\n\n🗣️**Talk Description**:\nIn this presentation, we’ll be taking a look at the data behind the Newcastle tech community. Many of these insights will be taken from Sarah’s latest project, NTP’s Salary Guide for 2024-25, complemented by insights from LinkedIn’s Data Dashboard, data collected from SEEK and more. We’ll take a walk through what some of these numbers mean for the future of tech in Newcastle, how we can collectively keep nudging the dial in the right direction and listen to Sarah furiously defend her choice to use pie charts.\n\n🎙️**Speaker Bio**:\nSarah Frazer is passionate about gathering way too much specific knowledge on everything from Neopet’s store prices to DNS structures to Australian spider species.
