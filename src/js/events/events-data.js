      "title": "NCSG APRIL 2025 | Matthew Flanagan: Attacking Next Gen Firewalls",
      "description": "Welcome back for Newcastle Cybersecurity Group's April event!\n\nThis month we're lucky to have Matthew Flanagan back to talk about research into next-generation firewalls (NGFW) and the opportunities they present to adversaries and defenders.\n\nWith the increasing incidence of critical vulnerabilities on next-generation firewalls, vendors and their customers face significant challenges in keeping up with firmware patches, mitigating exploitation risks, and safeguarding their edge devices and organizations.\n\nAs an adversary, if you land on a Palo Alto Networks next-generation firewall, what could you do next to further compromise the target environment?\n\nThis talk answers that question by uncovering how attackers can exploit weaknesses and overlooked features in these firewalls for maximum impact. We revisit a little-known fact: Palo Alto’s default master key (often left unchanged) can be leveraged to decrypt stored configuration secrets, exposing credentials and cryptographic keys previously thought secure.\n\nWe demonstrate how a compromised NGFW can be transformed from a security appliance into a valuable platform for credential harvesting, internal reconnaissance, and lateral movement. Beyond extracting sensitive data, an adversary can abuse built-in functionality to move deeper into the environment in ways most defenders have never considered.\n\nWe also show how the clientless VPN feature can be abused for internal network mapping, and how a threat actor may inject malicious code into VPN login portals to harvest credentials.To support these techniques, this talk introduces three custom tools developed during the research:\n\n* a Palo secret decryptor script for extracting encrypted secrets,\n* a clientless VPN port scanner for mapping internal services via the firewall’s VPN portal, and\n* a JavaScript gadget designed to harvest credentials from customizable VPN login portals.\n\nRed teamers and penetration testers will gain new strategies to target perimeter devices and turn them into offensive assets.\n\nDefenders will walk away with a clearer understanding of how next-generation firewalls can be turned against them, and practical steps to harden these critical systems.\n\n**Event details:**\n\nDate: **WEDNESDAY** April 23rd\n\nTime: 18:00-21:00\n\nVenue: 16 Honeysuckle Drive, Newcastle (The University of Newcastle 'Q Building') - second floor\n\nFood: PIZZAS Provided, please inform us of dietary requirements when RSVPing\n\nDrink: Non-alcoholic provided\n\n**Getting there/parking/public transport:**\n\n* Event location is [here](https://goo.gl/maps/rCqoDx8MbjqyeHTMA)\n* Please try and get in the door before 6:10pm. We check occasionally but you might get stuck outside in the cold for a while.\n* The [car park behind the building](https://goo.gl/maps/FzNNQfbAxxW38GNr7) is free after 5PM, and generally has plenty of room.\n* The closest public transport point is [Honeysuckle Light Rail Station](https://goo.gl/maps/3P2BpkiMaCeZ8isk9), which will take you to Newcastle Interchange and beyond every \\~7min or so. Walk along Honeysuckle Drive for a better-lit pathway.\n\n**The rest:**\n\nIf you’re experiencing any symptoms representative of COVID-19, please don’t attend. We’ll miss you, but the health/safety of attendees is paramount.\n\nNCSG is a community group determined to improve and uplift the Newcastle cybersecurity community. We meet monthly (on the last Wednesday of each month) and have a bunch of interesting speakers, from local legends to heavy hitters in the enterprise world.\n\n**Want to learn more?** Be sure to follow us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/newcastlecybersecuritygroup/) or visit newwwie.com, join the community and come and chat in the #security channel.\n\n**Keen on speaking?
