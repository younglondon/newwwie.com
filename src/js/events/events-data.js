      "description": "**🗣️Talk Description:** On this journey, we will discuss much about the human brain as this mystical, seemingly unattainable model. We'll also touch on the flaws and architectural design limitations of current artifical neural networks. Next will be a homage to spiking neural networks highlighting their more fantastic abilities juxtaposed to their curses. Finally we can cover some ground on where creativity stems from, and why we shouldn't let engineers model the brain. As a disclaimer the talk itself is going to be quite dense and probably a little too broad. However that's a consequence of adhd and I apologize for nothing.\n\n**🎙️Speaker Bio:** \"Hi. My name is Jacob Saunders, and I have been aggressively failing (and learning) for the last 10 years.

      "title": "NCSG November 2024 | CVSS, EPSS; ",
      "description": "G'day all!\n\nThis month we'll have Christian Heinrich presenting on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS).\n\nThe CVSS provides a way to capture the principal characteristics of a vulnerability and produce a numerical score reflecting its severity and/or threat intelligence. This numerical score can then be translated into a qualitative representation (such as low, medium, high, and critical) as part of vulnerability management.\n\nIts fourth major release (CVSS v4.0) was published from 1st November, 2023.\n\nThe Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) is a data-driven effort for estimating the likelihood (probability) that a software vulnerability will be exploited in the wild.\n\nChristian contributes to the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) and CVSS Special Interest Group (CVSS-SIG).\n\n**Event details:**\n\nDate: **WEDNESDAY** November 27th\n\nTime: 18:00-20:00\n\nVenue: 16 Honeysuckle Drive, Newcastle (The University of Newcastle 'Q Building') - second floor\n\nFood: PIZZAS Provided, please inform us of dietary requirements when RSVPing\n\nDrink: Non-alcoholic provided, come and grab a few with us at the pub after if you'd like!\n\n**Getting there/parking/public transport:**\n\n* Event location is [here](https://goo.gl/maps/rCqoDx8MbjqyeHTMA) \\- please use the western door\\. UoN requires us to keep this door closed for safety\\, so there will be someone there to let you in\\.\n* Please try and get in the door before 6:10pm. We check occasionally but you might get stuck outside in the cold for a while.\n* The [car park behind the building](https://goo.gl/maps/FzNNQfbAxxW38GNr7) is free after 5PM, and generally has plenty of room.\n* The closest public transport point is [Honeysuckle Light Rail Station](https://goo.gl/maps/3P2BpkiMaCeZ8isk9), which will take you to Newcastle Interchange and beyond every \\~7min or so. Walk along Honeysuckle Drive for a better-lit pathway.\n\n**The rest:**\n\nIf you’re experiencing any symptoms representative of COVID-19, please don’t attend. We’ll miss you, but the health/safety of attendees is paramount.\n\nNCSG is a community group determined to improve and uplift the Newcastle cybersecurity community. We meet monthly (on the last Wednesday of each month) and have a bunch of interesting speakers, from local legends to heavy hitters in the enterprise world.\n\n**Want to learn more?** Be sure to follow us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/newcastlecybersecuritygroup/) or visit newwwie.com, join the community and come and chat in the #security channel.\n\n**Keen on speaking?

Is that ok?** That's fine, we do prizes per round so you can arrive or leave as you need to.\n\n**How hard are the questions?** There are some hard ones, some easy ones, some stupid ones. We're not playing for sheep stations, so if you know nothing, that's fine.",
