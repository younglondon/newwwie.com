Worried you’ll break something important? Learn from another person’s mistakes instead! In this talk, Sarah takes you through her journey to become a DNS expert by breaking (a lot) of stuff. From domain registration to flushing public IP caches to DMARC authentication, we’ll explore some fo the gold DNS has to offer through the lens of how not to break things the way she did. We’ll cover the importance of patience, a crash course in working with support teams and why hilarious URLs aren’t always the best choice.Speaker Bio:\n\n**About Sarah**\nSarah Frazer is passionate about gathering way too much specific knowledge on everything from Neopet’s store prices to DNS structures to Australian spider species. She’s the co-founder of Coded Diversity, a not-for-profit focused on making the technology industry more sustainable for women and gender-diverse people and Chair of /NEW, Newcastle’s largest technology conference.
