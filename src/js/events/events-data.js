      "title": "August: Cole Cornford on Public Speaking",
      "description": "Howdy Coders,\nThis month, we'll have Cole Cornford deliver a master class on how to become a better public speaker.\n\nPublic speaking is a vital skill for all tech folk. At some point, you'll find yourself in front of a crowd giving a talk, and you'll need to be engaging and entertaining. This could involve daily tasks like presenting your work to stakeholders at a sprint demo, proposing a change to a technical steering committee, or stepping up to speak at a Meetup or Conference.\n\nWe'd like to thank our sponsors:\n\n* Saphi Engineering\n* Newy Tech People\n* Endava Newcastle",
