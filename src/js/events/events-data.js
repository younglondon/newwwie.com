      "description": "We are back in July with Stephen G giving us his experiences working with Rust and WASM and Stephen Y giving us a talk about graphs in software.\n\nStephen Ys talk will cover how a combination of the Rust memory checker, type system and macros makes web development easier, when compared with other single language front and backends like typescript/nodejs, and why Stephen started teaching Rust to primary school children. http://rustycc.com.au.\n\nStephen G's talk will cover Graphs and graph databases: what makes them useful, some popular use cases, some interesting edge cases, and the roles they can play supporting Generative AI.\n\nWe'd like to thank our sponsors\n\n* Mudbath\n* Saphi Engineering\n* Newy Tech People",
