      "title": "June; 2 talks; Mob Programming + AWS Project Development Kit",
      "description": "Howdy Coders,\nWe're back for June. This month we've got two talks from great presenters. Mark Tranter will be taking us through the AWS Project Development kit in a live-coding heavy session. The other talk will be at the complete opposite end of things with Klee Thomas (that's me) talking through Mob Programming his experiences working in this model.\n\nWe'll be hosting from the SSW Newcastle office. We'll have drinks and food supplied by our sponsors.\n\nWe'd like to thank our sponsors\n\n* [SSW](https://www.ssw.com.au/)\n* [V2](https://www.v2.digital/)\n* [Saphi Engineering](https://saphi.engineering/)\n\n**Mob Programming:**\nAre you finding that your delivery has slowed down? Do you have a lot of work in progress but struggle to get things done? Are you interested in how you can deliver more value with your existing team? Then this talk is for you.\nIn this talk, Klee will go through his experiences with mob programming and how it can be used to optimise your development process so that you're delivering value to customers, and making your team more engaged at the same time.\n\n**AWS Project Development Kit**\nThe AWS Project Development Kit (AWS PDK) provides building blocks for common patterns together with development tools to manage and build your projects.\nThe AWS PDK lets you define your projects programmatically via the expressive power of type-safe constructs. In this live-coding talk Mark will go through using AWS PDK to build out an app in front of your eyes.",

      "title": "WGDPTech Meet-up: Working Through Career Grief: What Is It & How to Move Forward",
      "description": "Our June speaker for Women and Gender Diverse People in Tech is Shonavee Simpson-Anderson!\n\nCareer grief can be a heartbreaking, even maddening, experience and we don't talk about it enough... or at all, really. We talk about \"quiet quitting\" and \"working your wage\". But we don't talk about the larger grief these ideas come from or the fact that we can grieve aspects of our work-life. Maybe this is because in a hyper-productive, produce-til-you-die work culture it's a bit unfashionable to display these feelings over capitalist labour. Maybe it's because we don't recognise what we're actually experiencing is grief. So let's talk about it with Shonavee Simpson-Anderson - a would-have-been-book-publisher turned SEO professional. She is the Senior SEO Strategist at Firewire Digital and Co-Founder/Organiser of Edge of Search - Newcastle's first SEO conference.\n\n**5:30PM:** The event starts with a catch-up\n**6:00PM:** The presentation will begin\n\n**Don't forget our 2024 location!** We'll gather at the NewyTechPeople office at 9 Downie St, Maryville NSW for this event.\n\nEveryone is welcome to this event, regardless of gender- so share it with your friends. Through these speaker events, we aim to share experiences and knowledge, that's how we learn, and that's how we can improve the community for everyone.\n\nWe provide food, so let us know of any allergies :)",
