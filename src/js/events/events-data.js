Well, modern chatbots can tackle these questions better than most academics‚Äîand now with less than half the post-structuralism! But if you want the blissfully tortuous, existentialism-free version, you‚Äôll still need a human grappling with Aristotle and de Saussure through strained neural network analogies he barely understands.\n\n**üéôÔ∏èSpeaker Bio:** Stephen Hicks dropped out of the last year of computer engineering, unfortunately after passing the mandatory philosophy subject. He still has nightmares about cybernetic snail flukes. He has since finished a TAFE diploma in databases and data management he feels prepared him for the advent of an all consuming ontological totality\n\nüè¢ **Venue**: NewyTechPeople Offices L2, 9 Downie St, Maryville NSW 2293\n\n[https://maps.app.goo.gl/QssJqKTbwyaKQMxu9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QssJqKTbwyaKQMxu9)\n\n* We will meet on the Level 2 Seminar Space.\n\n##-------------------------------------------------------------------##\n\nüï† TIME: 5.30pm - 7.30pm\n\nFOOD: üçï + ü•§\n\n* Wood fired pizza, sponsored by NewyTechPeople\n* Soft drinks\n\nSCHEDULE:\n\n* 5:30pm: Networking + Food + Drinks\n\n(Don't stress if you are held up in traffic)\n\n* 6:15pm: Presentation\n* 7:15pm: Packing up + Bonus questions\n* 7:30pm: Close\n* 7:30pm+: [Unofficially] anyone wanting to continue chatting, we usually head to a bar (The Maryville Tavern) which is a short walk from the venue.",

The age-old battle between Product Owners and Developers rages on: POs push for speed, while devs demand clarity. When specs are too vague, developers waste time making assumptions. When specs are too detailed, POs get bogged down in documentation.\nThe result? Context switching, frustration, and a backlog filled with half-baked work items.\nIn this talk, Adam Cogan will show how AI powered tools like **YakShaver** (for GitHub and Azure DevOps) and recently **Loom** (for Jira) can act as the ultimate peacemaker.\nThese tools capture discussions, structuring work items, and ensuring that every backlog item is ready‚Ä¶ and assigned to the right backlog‚Äîall automatically.\nLearn the lessons from deploying AI to solve one of the most persistent struggles in software development. This talk will show you how AI brings balance to your team.\nBonus: See how a solution can be:\n\\* better with Microsoft Teams to capture audio + video, and leverage Whisper for transcription, all glued together with GPT-4o to generate structured content.\n\\* have a decision-tree architecture with Semantic Kernel orchestration to enable seamless integration with Azure DevOps, GitHub, and more.",
