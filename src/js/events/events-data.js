      "description": "In November, we'll be hearing from Heather on how she's mastered soft skills in hard environments. She'll pull on learnings from her dynamic career to share some of her key skills to surviving and thriving in complex workplaces.\n\nHeather Veronique Morris is a dedicated System Administrator and aspiring Cyber Security professional with over 12 years of experience in the tech industry. For seven years, she served as an Apple Certified Technician, honing her technical support skills and customer service expertise. Currently, she is a Network Technician in the Royal Australian Air Force, where she also takes on the role of IT Security Manager.\n\nAs a woman navigating a male-dominated field, she aims to encourage more women and girls to pursue careers in technology. Heather understands that entering and thriving in these environments can sometimes feel unwelcoming, and she is passionate about sharing the experiences and strategies she has developed to carve out her space.\n\n**5:30PM:** The event starts with a catch-up\n**6:00PM:** The presentation will begin\n\nDon't forget our 2024 location! We'll gather at the NewyTechPeople office at 9 Downie St, Maryville NSW for this event.\n\nEveryone is welcome to this event, regardless of gender- so share it with your friends. Through these speaker events, we aim to share experiences and knowledge, that's how we learn, and that's how we can improve the community for everyone. We provide food, so let us know of any allergies :)",

      "description": "**🗣️Talk Description:** On this journey, we will discuss much about the human brain as this mystical, seemingly unattainable model. We'll also touch on the flaws and architectural design limitations of current artifical neural networks. Next will be a homage to spiking neural networks highlighting their more fantastic abilities juxtaposed to their curses. Finally we can cover some ground on where creativity stems from, and why we shouldn't let engineers model the brain. As a disclaimer the talk itself is going to be quite dense and probably a little too broad. However that's a consequence of adhd and I apologize for nothing.\n\n**🎙️Speaker Bio:** \"Hi. My name is Jacob Saunders, and I have been aggressively failing (and learning) for the last 10 years. I have failed at many things, ranging from McDonald's crew person, to professional battery builder all the way over to pure mathematician.

      "title": "NCSG November 2024 | CVSS, EPSS; ",
      "description": "G'day all!\n\nThis month we'll have Christian Heinrich presenting on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS).\n\nThe CVSS provides a way to capture the principal characteristics of a vulnerability and produce a numerical score reflecting its severity and/or threat intelligence. This numerical score can then be translated into a qualitative representation (such as low, medium, high, and critical) as part of vulnerability management.\n\nIts fourth major release (CVSS v4.0) was published from 1st November, 2023.\n\nChristian contributes to the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) Special Interest Group (SIG).\n\n**Event details:**\n\nDate: **WEDNESDAY** November 27th\n\nTime: 18:00-20:00\n\nVenue: 16 Honeysuckle Drive, Newcastle (The University of Newcastle 'Q Building') - second floor\n\nFood: PIZZAS Provided, please inform us of dietary requirements when RSVPing\n\nDrink: Non-alcoholic provided, come and grab a few with us at the pub after if you'd like!\n\n**Getting there/parking/public transport:**\n\n* Event location is [here](https://goo.gl/maps/rCqoDx8MbjqyeHTMA) \\- please use the western door\\. UoN requires us to keep this door closed for safety\\, so there will be someone there to let you in\\.\n* Please try and get in the door before 6:10pm. We check occasionally but you might get stuck outside in the cold for a while.\n* The [car park behind the building](https://goo.gl/maps/FzNNQfbAxxW38GNr7) is free after 5PM, and generally has plenty of room.\n* The closest public transport point is [Honeysuckle Light Rail Station](https://goo.gl/maps/3P2BpkiMaCeZ8isk9), which will take you to Newcastle Interchange and beyond every \\~7min or so. Walk along Honeysuckle Drive for a better-lit pathway.\n\n**The rest:**\n\nIf you’re experiencing any symptoms representative of COVID-19, please don’t attend. We’ll miss you, but the health/safety of attendees is paramount.\n\nNCSG is a community group determined to improve and uplift the Newcastle cybersecurity community. We meet monthly (on the last Wednesday of each month) and have a bunch of interesting speakers, from local legends to heavy hitters in the enterprise world.\n\n**Want to learn more?** Be sure to follow us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/newcastlecybersecuritygroup/) or visit newwwie.com, join the community and come and chat in the #security channel.\n\n**Keen on speaking?
