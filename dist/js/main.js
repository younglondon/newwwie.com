Join us for a fun and eye-opening chat about using Large Language Models (LLMs) to build lightweight security solutions that actually work (most the time, kind of)!\n\n**What's in it for you:**\n\n* Discover how everyday AI tools can become your cybersecurity sidekick\n* See real examples of clever security tools built with AI\n* Learn why this approach is gaining traction (and where it might trip you up)\n* Get practical tips you can actually use\n* Understand the good, the bad, and the \"O RLY?\" of AI-powered security\n\nThis session is perfect for anyone curious about where technology is heading. Whether you're just getting into IT, studying cybersecurity, already deep in the tech world, or a business owner trying to make sense of all this AI buzz – you'll walk away with real insights and maybe even some inspiration for your next project.\n\n**Meet Your Speaker:** Andrew Stace is the kind of guy who gets excited about both the latest AI breakthroughs and the nitty-gritty of keeping systems secure. As Lead Security Capabilities Specialist at nib Group, he's hands-on with the challenges we all face in today's digital world. Plus, he's (allegedly) great at explaining complex stuff without making your head spin\\*.\n\n**Come along if you're:**\n\n* Curious about IT and want to learn something new\n* A student exploring what's possible in tech\n* A seasoned pro looking for fresh perspectives\n* Already in cybersecurity and wondering about AI's role\n* A business owner who wants to understand what all this means for you\n\n**Event details:**\n\nVenue: 16 Honeysuckle Drive, Newcastle (The University of Newcastle 'Q Building') - second floor\n\nFood: PIZZAS Provided, please inform us of dietary requirements when RSVPing\n\nDrink: Non-alcoholic provided\n\n**Getting there/parking/public transport:**\n\n* Event location is [here](https://goo.gl/maps/rCqoDx8MbjqyeHTMA)\n* Please try and get in the door before 6:10pm.

If you're still using ChatGPT or CoPilot chat to help you \"pair program\" this talk will show you that you're leaving productivity on the table. Expect to come away from this talk a more productive developer.\n\n**Strategic Framework for Achieving Organisational Goals**\nIn a rapidly evolving business landscape, success is rarely accidental—it’s the product of deliberate strategy. This talk introduces a clear, actionable framework for aligning efforts across an organisation to achieve meaningful outcomes. We’ll explore the foundational elements of strategy: diagnosing challenges, crafting a guiding policy, and executing coherent actions. You’ll learn how organizational structure, OKRs (Objectives and Key Results), and quarterly roadmaps serve as critical tools to maintain alignment and momentum. Whether you're leading a team or shaping company-wide initiatives, this session will equip you with a structured approach to drive progress and deliver impact.",dateTime:"2025-07-02T18:00+10:00",eventUrl:"https://www.meetup.com/newcastle-coders-group/events/308521671",going:8,maxTickets:0,duration:"PT3H",imageUrl:"https://secure-content.meetupstatic.com/images/classic-events/505406540/676x380.webp",venue:{name:"Endava Newcastle",lat:-32.926075,lng:151.7626,address:"8/710 Hunter Street",city:"Newcastle"}},group:{name:"Newcastle Coders Group",urlname:"newcastle-coders-group",groupPhoto:{id:"505406540",baseUrl:"https://secure-content.meetupstatic.com/images/classic-events/",preview:null},logo:{id:"505406540",baseUrl:"https://secure-content.meetupstatic.com/images/classic-events/",preview:null}}},{event:{title:"data.JUL <- TBD Save the date",description:"**EOI Call for Speakers** 🗣️🎙️\n[https://forms.gle/fnWkDmzmdPvs7z7WA](https://forms.gle/fnWkDmzmdPvs7z7WA)\nWe are yet to lock in a speaker for this month.
